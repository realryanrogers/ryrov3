**Quick Thoughts**

This may be a smooth brain take, but infinite wealth does NOT need to take as long as it does to get going. I get that's it's not as bad as some other entries in the yakuza series, but I touched the controller for about 10 minutes in the first 3 hours. 

When you do get to play, however, it's a lot of fun. The battling is fun, the minigames are fun, the story is the exact amount of campy melodrama that it needs to be. Basically it's every other yakuza game, and I'm ok with that. 

The yakuza devs are good at innovating exactly as much as needed to keep things feeling fresh, but also familiar. 

It has some interesting things to say about a lot of aspects of society. How we treat former criminals, how we let gossip form our opinions, and even how America deals with (or, really *doesn't* deal with) homelessness. 

Luckily, it also intersperses some great absurdity into the mix in the moments in between. 

I don't like how trinkitorious it is. It's hard for my brain to ignore the 30 shiny objects that exist on the way to my objective. 

Most of the mini games are pretty good, but I will NOT be interacting with the animal crossing thing. I can't spend that much time with something.
