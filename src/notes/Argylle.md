When I first saw the trailer, I was excited. I'm a fan of Matthew Vaughn's styling (for the most part). The early critic reviews, however, did a lot to simmer me down. After seeing it, however, I'm very confident in saying this is being over hated. 

It's messy, and the story doesn't make the most sense, and some things get a little predictable. But, on the other hand, I think those negatives are something that helps the film be what it is. It's just a fun little spycraft action movie with some awesome set pieces. 

Everyone was excellently cast. Bryce Dallas Howard is perfect, and Sam Rockwell was amazing (even if I thought it was Will Forte at first). Even Henry Cavill was used perfectly here. 

Even with all the good things about the it, the film is at least 30 minutes too long. There's no reason for this one to be over 2 hours long. The story is convoluted enough that a lot of the beats could have been done without. 

Past the story, my only other real complaint with the movie is the CGI. Argylle is not helping hollywood beat the allegations as vfx just getting worse and worse. 

So all in all, I was happy with the movie and would gladly watch another one in the franchise that it looks like it's trying to set up (although the box office numbers may have something else to say about it).
