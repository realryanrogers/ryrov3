### Synopsis
Starting with a barren wasteland, you must use the tools at your disposal to turn the area back into a lush paradise.
### Quick Thoughts
- Frictionless game. Even cozy games have decisions to be made that effects things and lets you see what your decisions have caused. This game provides none of that. This results in a boring game.
- The one real resource that you have get's ballooned to meaninglessness very quickly. 
- Not a city-builder nor a "reverse city-builder". It's closer to a puzzle game. 
- The puzzle aspect is under served though. There's no failure state, and you can just brute force your way through basically everything.
