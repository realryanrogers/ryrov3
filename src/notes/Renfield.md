This movie starts off with a ton of great ideas. Bringing Renfield into the modern day as a character with wishes and dreams that's tired of the servant life, and playing out the situation via a support group for toxic relationships is a fun and fresh idea. Unfortunately, they don't really inject enough personality into it and it ends up feeling same-y and forgettable. Pair that with the short run time, and I was hard pressed to remember that I had even watched this a couple days later. 

I didn't like Cage in this when compared to other Cage performances. It felt too much like he was asked to play himself, and the movie was built around his style of acting, which counter intuitively makes his performance less interesting. Even with this being one of his weaker performances, Cage was still the best part of the movie, sadly.

Awkwafina I think did a fine job with her character, but we didn't need as much of her character as we got. We didn't spend enough time at all on the Dracula/Renfield relationship, and way too much time on the Renfield/Awkwafina relationship. 

Despite trying very hard, the movie was not at all as funny as it thinks it is. The jokes are just bland and predictable. 

The violence felt almost forced. Like it was trying to be something that would be talked about, but it was, again, just more of the same type of hyper violence you'll see in better works that have something to say with it, but without that underlying motivation for it.
