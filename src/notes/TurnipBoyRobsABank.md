Gameplay wise I am extremely mixed on this one. It has a lot of competent ideas, the moment to moment loop is fairly fun. I love the idea of the bite sized run, having only a few minutes to make progress, get cash, or to complete a quest. It kept everything quick and light, and I could feel comfortable booting the game up for a 15 minute session in between tasks. 

On the other hand, most all of the gameplay on offer has been done better in other games. This might not be a fair comparison, but it just feels like Nuclear Throne got mixed with Enter the Gungeon, but wasn't cooked long enough. Some guns certainly feel better than others, but none of them really feel *great*. 

The writing is good, and there's a lot of great jokes, but how they are presented makes me hate the dialog system to the point of skipping pretty much everything. The pauses mid speech that you have to click through are annoying enough, but I do not need Turnip Boy's input in the proceedings. If you're going to be a silent protagonist, that should also mean you forgo a "???" text response. 

Overall it's a competent game, but ultimately forgettable.
