### Synopsis
You play as Chai, a young guy who dreams of being a rockstar. After the install of a cybernetic arm went awry, the company he works for is trying to kill him, and Chai must battle his way out with the power of alternative rock music.

### Quick Notes.

I was a little scared about this being a rhythm game, as I am absolutely horrible with anything requiring timing and being able to keep a beat (I'm also dog trash at any type of parry mechanic). Hi-Fi rush keeps me into it by flipping one of the mainstays of rhythm games on its head. Instead of punishing the player for missing a beat, they reward you when you hit it, instead. It sounds the same, but in practice there is a world of difference. 

When I miss a beat on an attack, Chai still attacks when he normally would, but I just deal normal damage. When I hit the attack at the exact right time, he does *extra* damage. A subtle change that makes all the difference, so a dummy like me can still play and have the combat feel good.

Now all that said, I did have trouble with the actual parry sections. They timing there was a lot less forgiving. 

The writing is good, and I like the characters. The voice acting also seems fine in a vacuum, but when you combine it into conversations, it can feel like everyone is talking at one another instead of to one another.

Despite each battle essentially being you in an area with a group of  mobs, the combat never felt too same-y. The enemy variety and group dynamics helped to keep things fresh.

The bosses were great. A lot of fun to play against, and also just really good characters.

The art and animation are so good. I've never seen a game do such a good job turning a 3d game into something where every frame looks like a 2d drawing. 

Most of the music is original, and very good, but when they drop a licensed track, it hits very hard. Each pick elevates the sequence that they are part of. Nine inch nails, Number Girl, The Prodigy, all great.

The platforming sections are the weakest part, by far. 

I love that the villains are cartoon style. No trying to show them as flawed by human. They are just evil, and it kind of rules.
