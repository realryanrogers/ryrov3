### Synopsis
After botching a job, a meticulous hitman goes for vengeance. 

### Quick Thoughts
This movie is different than I thought it was going to be. It feels less like a thriller, and more like competence porn (not necessarily a bad thing). 

The Killer is such a machine-like character that it's hard to feel any sort of emotional connection to him, but maybe that's intentional. It perhaps leads me to a headspace closer to that of the movie's namesake. 

Fincher's camerawork remains a cut above. 

Fassbender does a great job, which is good because this whole movie is just the Fassbender show. Not to say that the supporting characters didn't also do a great job, but most people get one to two minutes on screen at most. Tilda Swinton was phenomenal in the one scene she had.

Not an action movie, but there was one fight scene action set piece that kind of blew me away. I think it was made all the more explosive by being in the middle of what is really a slow paced movie.

I kept expecting the movie to get more complicated, or for Fassbender's character to get more complex, but it never happened. At first that slightly irked me, but the more I think about it, the more interesting I think that makes the movie.
