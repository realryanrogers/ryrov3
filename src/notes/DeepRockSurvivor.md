I'm a big Deep Rock Galactic guy, and a big Vampire Survivors guy, but I was a little hesitant about DRG: Survivor. I've played a good amount of survivor style games, and none of them hit for me like the original did. This being an early access game doesn't help stack the odds in the game's favor, but I decided to go for it.

6 hours later, I was still playing. 

I'm not sure what about this is even early access. It feels like a full game so far. Just based on what I've played, if I bought this as a 1.0 release (especially at the bargain price of 10 bucks), and it never updated, it would still be a massively good pickup. 

The main change in the gameplay comes from mining. Needing to collect resources for the meta progression and the side goals in the level. This keeps you from just having to run away at all times, and actually strategize how you're leading the hordes around. 

The runs are pretty fast, and so far they have enough variety to keep me engaged. I do wish there was perhaps a different balance between the length of the full run, and the time spent on levels. It feels like the levels go by too quickly, and you don't have a chance to explore. On the other hand, that does help add some urgency to your mining strategies. 

The upgrades and unlocks seem almost endless. Of course you have your upgrades, but you also have classes, skills, biomes, challenges, and more that all need to be discovered and unlocked. 

My first long session aside, I think this game will stick with me for a long while as a quick pick up and play a bit when I have half an hour to kill.
