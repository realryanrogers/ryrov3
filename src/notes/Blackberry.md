Watched this on an airplane not expecting much. I had heard that Glenn Howerton did a good job, but that was the extent of my pre-knowledge coming into this one. I assumed it was going to be another of this years kind of vapid 5 out of 10 company biopics, but it turned out to be so much more. 

Glenn Howerton is indeed *so* good in this. Every line that comes out of his mouth just feels so good. Surprising to me was Jay Baruchel. He played the transition from awkward engineer to business guy very well. 

They had to cover some fairly technical concepts in the movie in order to show just how innovative RIM actually was back in the day, and they handled is extremely well. All the technical things felt very accessible and also not so surface level as to sound jargony.  

I liked the background story of the company itself transitioning away from the original culture of nerds hanging out and solving hard problems together and into a more recognizable large company culture that views anything outside of direct productivity to be detrimental to the point that it must be stomped out.

When I was done with the movie, I thought it was a pretty good one. A 6 out of 10, but the more I sit with it, the more its growing on me. It's a movie that's staying with me. I'm very surprised that I've not heard more about this film through the year.
