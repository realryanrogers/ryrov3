### Synopsis
A traveler from somewhere else explores a diverse land with many languages that he does not speak. You have to explore and find context for words to begin to understand what is happening.

### Quick Notes
Puzzle games usually make me feel stupid right up until you get the answer you were looking for. This one manages to keep me feeling like I'm right on the cusp of something, and I just have to keep pushing and looking for clues. 

The way you guess the meaning of words first, and have that guess overlaid in the world while you figure out the context was genius. It really feels like you're having to learn something foreign. 

It's the best abstraction of language that I've ever seen. 

I did not like the sections that weren't about the language though. The platform/stealth/traditional puzzle sections were a little stinky.

It probably wouldn't work, but I'm curious about this trying this puzzle model with a real language. 

Visuals are stunning in their simplicity. They are beautiful, but not distracting, keeping your focus on the puzzles.
