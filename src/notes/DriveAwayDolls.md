An 89 minutes movie that moves extremely fast, but also simultaneously feels like there was too much fluff. It's like this should have been an hour long episode of a TV show. 

It's pretty hard not to compare the movie to last year's Bottoms, and Drive Away Dolls does not come out of that favorably. Most of the jokes land, and there were at least a few jokes that *really* landed, but for a straight up comedy I would have liked to see more jokes. 

I think all the actors involved did a good job. Margaret Qualley's fast talking Jamie was a lot of fun. If the movie was any longer I could see it getting old eventually, but it served well in such a short film. Geraldine Viswanathan also played her character perfectly. 

All in all I left the theater feeling like I had a good snack, but nothing of any real substance.
