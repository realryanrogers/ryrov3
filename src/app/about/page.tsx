            <p>
                I'm originally from the American Southwest, but I'm currently based out of Jersey City, NJ after a few stints in Brooklyn and Austin.

                I love to create, especially when it's something that can bring a little joy to someone else.
                While cooking has always been a shortcut to that goal, I'm focusing my energy now on game development.

                I love to learn new concepts and to pick things apart to figure out how they work. 
                I've found that new ideas stick in my head a lot longer when I write them down, 
                so I started this site as a place to store my notes, in case any else might find them useful.
